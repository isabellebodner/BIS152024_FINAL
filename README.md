# BIS152024_FINAL

# Research Topic:

For our final project, we wanted to learn more about patterns in homelessness in the State of California. We wanted to investigate how rates of homelessness changed over time, for different groups of people in different locations.

# Summary:

We used data from the State of California, Continuum of Care to analyze the count of homeless individuals broken up by race, location and age group over time. We investigated the data, cleaned it, and created graphs that helped us analyze patterns within different groups. Additionally, we made an app that would help filter different categories of data to create a graphical representation of the trends we looked into.

# Individual contributions:

We each used a different R markdown file to do our data analysis, distinguished by our names, to show the different work we each contributed to the project.

# Understanding our repository:

We have two data sets, an individual app titled race.app, one combined app that includes the app looking at race and the app looking at age groups into one, and our seperate code we wrote to complete the project.
