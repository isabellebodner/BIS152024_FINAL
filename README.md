# Research Topic:

For our final project, we wanted to learn more about patterns in homelessness in the State of California. We wanted to investigate how rates of homelessness changed over time, for different groups of people in different counties in California.

# Summary:

We used data from the State of California, Continuum of Care to analyze the number of homeless individuals broken up by race, location and age group over time. We investigated, cleaned and visualized the  data through graphs that helped us analyze patterns within different groups. Additionally, we made a ShinyApp that would help compare different categories of data like race, county, and age group to create a more accessible, visual representation of how the number of homeless individuals in the specified category change over time. 

# Individual contributions:

We each used a different R markdown file to do our data analysis, distinguished by our names, to show the different work we each contributed to the project.

# Understanding our repository:

We have two data sets: 

* race.csv
* age.csv

individual app: 

* race.app - Shiny App that investigates different races in different counties of California over time

Final app: 

* combined.app - Shiny app that includes the previous app looking at race and the app looking at age groups into one

Seperate Coding Work: 

* isabelle.Rmd
* maya-fujita-code.Rmd

Presentation slides:
