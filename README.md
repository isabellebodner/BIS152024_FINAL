# BIS152024_FINAL

# Research Top:

For our final project, we wanted to learn more about patterns in homelessness in the State of California. We wanted to investigate how rates of homelessness changed over time, for different groups of people in different locations.

# Summary:

We used data from the State of California, Continuum of Care to analyze the count of homeless individuals broken up by race, location and age group over time. We investigated the data, cleaned it, and created graphs that helped us analyze patterns within different groups. Additionally, we made an app that would help filter different categories of data to create a graphical representation of the trends we looked into.

# Individual contributions

We each used a different R markdown file to do our data analysis, distinguished by our names, to show the different work we each contributed to the project.

# Understanding out suppository:

We have two data sets, two individual apps, one combined app that just puts both of the previos apps in the same place, and our seperate code we used to complete the project.
